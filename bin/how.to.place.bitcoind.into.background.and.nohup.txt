If the equibitd is run with -eb_usehsm=true, then it cannot be run as a daemon. It must be connected
to the terminal at startup to receive the pass phrase. After startup, if there is a need to close
the terminal, then do the following first:

1) Start equibitd using ./run.equibitd

2) Ctrl-Z 
   Stops the process.

3) Use the jobs command to get job number of the task.

4) bg <equibitd-job#>
   For example, bg 1.
   This step may have to be repeated until the process is running in the background.

5) disown -h
   Prevents process from being killed when terminal is closed.

After successfully executing the steps listed above, one can close the terminal without causing the
server to receive a signal and shut down.
