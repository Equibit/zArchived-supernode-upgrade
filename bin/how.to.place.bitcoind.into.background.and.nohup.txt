If the bitcoind is run with -eb_usehsm=true, then it cannot be run as a daemon. It must be connected
to the terminal at startup to receive the pass phrase. After startup, if there is a need to close
the terminal, then do the following first:

1) Start bitcoind using ./run.bitcoind

2) Ctrl-Z 
	Stops process.

3) jobs to get job number of task

4) bg <bitcoind-job#>
	For example, bg 1.

5) disown -h %1
	Prevents process from being killed when terminal is closed.
