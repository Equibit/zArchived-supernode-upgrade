If the equibitd is run with -eb_usehsm=true, then it cannot be run as a daemon. It must be connected
to the terminal at startup to receive the pass phrase. After startup, if there is a need to close
the terminal, then do the following first:

1) Start equibitd using ./run.equibitd

2) Ctrl-Z 
   Stops the process.
   Note the job number. The terminal typically displays

   [1]+  Stopped                 ./run.equibitd

   1 is the job number.

3) bg <equibitd-job#>

   For example, bg 1.

   After this command is executed press Enter several times. If the line

   [1]+  Stopped                 ./run.equibitd

   is displayed, repeat the bg command. When

   [1]+ ./run.equibitd &

   is displayed, the process is running in the background.

5) disown -h
   Prevents process from being killed when terminal is closed.

After successfully executing the steps listed above, one can close the terminal without causing the
server to receive a signal and shut down.
