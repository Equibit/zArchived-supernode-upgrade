<h1>Equibit User Guide</h1>

<p>This document describes how to use a Equibit Node and the RPC client.</p>
<p>An Equibit Node consists of a full Bitcoin Core implementation and a Equibit Core implementation.</p>

<h2>Getting Help</h2>

<h3>bitcoin-cli help</h3>

<p>Currently there is one RPC client program (bitcoin-cli) that is used to connect to both the Bitcoin Core and the Equibit Core. To get a list of command line options for bitcoin-cli, use</p>
<xmp>
./bitcoin-cli -help
</xmp>

<h3>Equibit Node Command Line Options</h3>

<p>To get a list of all command line options supported by the Bitcoin Core and Equibit Core, run the command:</p>

<xmp>
./bitcoind -help
</xmp>

<p>To also get a list of the Bitcoin Core debugging command line options, run the command:</p>

<xmp>
./bitcoind -help -help-debug
</xmp>
<p>The -eb_* versions of these commands will also work. That is,</p>
<xmp>
./bitcoind -eb_help -eb_help-debug
</xmp>

<p>See below for getting help for RPC commands.</p>

<h3>Configuring the Node to support RPC processing</h3>

<p>
If a node is running, the RPC (Remote Procedure Call) client program (bitcoin-cli) can be used to communicate with it provided it is configured appropriately. HTTP client programs such as curl can also be used to communicate with an Equibit node.
</p>

<p>In order for an Equibit node to handle RPC requests, the following steps must be done.</p>

<ol>
<li>Start the node with the -server option for Bitcoin Core RPC communication.</li>
<li>Start the node with the -eb_server option for Equibit Core RPC communication.</li>
<li>Define the rpcuser and rpcpassword options in the bitcoin.conf file</li>
</ol>

<p>The bitcoin.conf file is located in the Bitcoin Core data directory. The default value is <xmp>~/.bitcoin</xmp>. It can be set with the -datadir option. Therefore, the default location of bitconn.conf is <xmp>~/.bitcoin/bitcoin.confg</xmp></p>

<p>The equibit.conf file is located in the Equibit Core data directory. The default value is <xmp>~/.equibit</xmp> It can be set with the -eb_datadir option.</p>

<p>The syntax of the rpcpassword definition (to be placed in the bitcoin.conf file) is:</p>
<code>
rpcpassword=<em>any-sequence-of-characters</em>
</code>

<p>The syntax of the eb_rpcpassword definition (to be placed in the equibit.conf file) is:</p>
<code>
eb_rpcpassword=<em>any-sequence-of-characters</em>
</code>


<h3>Equibit Node RPC Help</h3>

<p>Assuming the Node is running, a RPC client program can request a list of supported RPCs using the <em>help</em> RPC for Bitcoin RPCs and <em>eb_help</em> RPC for Equibit RPCs.</p>
<p>The Equibit RPC listening port is different from the Bitcoin RPC listening port. Since the RPC client will default to using the Bitcoin RPC listening port, the Equibit RPC requests also require the -rpcport option to be specified with the Equibit RPC port.</p>
<p>If another client program is used to connect to the Node, then the port specified will determine which RPCs should be used.</p>

<p>Therefore, the following commands will list the Bitcoin Core RPCs and the Equibit RPCs respectively:</p>

<xmp>
./bitcoin-cli help
</xmp>

<xmp>
./bitcoin-cli -rpcport=18331 eb_help
</xmp>

<p>Getting detailed help on individual RPCs can be done by specifying help (resp. eb_help) followed by the name of the command. For example, to get detailed help on the getinfo (resp. eb_getinfo) RPC, use the following commands:
</p>

<xmp>
./bitcoin-cli help getinfo
</xmp>

<xmp>
./bitcoin-cli -rpcport=18331 eb_help eb_getinfo
</xmp>

<h2>Networks</h2>

<p>The Bitcoin Core and the Equibit Core can connect to three different networks.</p>

<ul>
<li>The default network that the Bitcoin Core will connect to is the Bitcoin network.</li>
<li>The default network that the Equibit Core will connect to is the Equibit network.</li>
<li>If the -testnet option is specified, then the Bitcoin Core will connect to the Bitcoin test network</li>
<li>If the -eb_testnet option is specified, then the Equibit Core will connect to the Equibit test network</li>
<li>If the -regtest option is specified, then the Bitcoin Core will connect to the Bitcoin regression test network</li>
<li>If the -eb_testnet option is specified, then the Equibit Core will connect to the Equibit regression test network</li>
</ul>

<p>If the -regtest (resp. -eb_regtest) option is specified, then the Bitcoin Core (resp. Equibit Core) is run in
regression test mode. When run in this mode, a special chain in which blocks can be solved instantly is used. This is intended for regression testing tools and app development.</p>

<p>The network used determines where all files generated by a Core are placed. The path of files generated will have
the following prefix:</p>

<table cellspacing=0 border=1>
<tr><th>Network</th><th>Path Prefix</th></tr>

<tr><td>Bitcoin Core Network</td><td><em>Bitcoin-data-directory</em></td></tr>
<tr><td>Bitcoin Core Test Network</td><td><em>Bitcoin-data-directory</em>/testnet3</td></tr>
<tr><td>Bitcoin Core Regression Test Network</td><td><em>Bitcoin-data-directory</em>/regtest</td></tr>

<tr><td>Equibit Core Network</td><td><em>Equibit-data-directory</em></td></tr>
<tr><td>Equibit Core Test Network</td><td><em>Equibit-data-directory</em>/testnet3</td></tr>
<tr><td>Equibit Core Regression Test Network</td><td><em>Equibit-data-directory</em>/regtest</td></tr>
</table>

<p>The <em>Bitcoin-data-directory</em> defaults to ~/.bitcoin. It can be set with the -datadir option</p>
<p>The <em>Equibit-data-directory</em> defaults to ~/.equibit. It can be set with the -eb_datadir option</p>

<h2>Logging</h2>

<p>Both Cores can be configured to generate log messages. The location of the log file is determined by the network
used by each Core as follows:</p>

<table cellspacing=0 border=1>
<tr><th>Network</th><th>Path Prefix</th></tr>

<tr><td>Bitcoin Core Network</td><td><em>Bitcoin-data-directory</em>/debug.log</td></tr>
<tr><td>Bitcoin Core Test Network</td><td><em>Bitcoin-data-directory</em>/testnet3/debug.log</td></tr>
<tr><td>Bitcoin Core Regression Test Network</td><td><em>Bitcoin-data-directory</em>/regtest/debug.log</td></tr>

<tr><td>Equibit Core Network</td><td><em>Equibit-data-directory</em>/debug.log</td></tr>
<tr><td>Equibit Core Test Network</td><td><em>Equibit-data-directory</em>/testnet3/debug.log</td></tr>
<tr><td>Equibit Core Regression Test Network</td><td><em>Equibit-data-directory</em>/regtest/debug.log</td></tr>
</table>

<h3>Logging Options</h3>

<p>The following options control logging</p>

<table cellspacing=0 border=1>
<tr><th>Bitcoin Option</th><th>Equibit Option</th><th>Description</th></tr>

<tr>
<td>-dblogsize=<em>n</em></td>
<td>-eb_dblogsize=<em>n</em></td>

<h2>Configuring Node Connectitivity</h2>

<p>The following options can be used to control to which Equibit Nodes a given node will connect. 
The options that control Equibit Node connectivity are:</p>

<dl>
<dt>-eb_addnode=<em>ip-list</em></dt>
	<dd>Add a node to connect to and attempt to keep the connection open</dd>
<dt>-eb_connect=<em>ip-list</em></dt>
	<dd>Connect only to the specified node(s)</dd>
<dt>-eb_dns</dt>
	<dd>Allow DNS lookups for -addnode, -seednode and -connect (default: true)</dd>
<dt>-eb_dnsseed</dt>
	<dd>Query for peer addresses via DNS lookup, if low on addresses (default: true unless -connect)</dd>
<dt>-eb_forcednsseed</dt>
	<dd>Always query for peer addresses via DNS lookup (default: 0)</dd>
<dt>-eb_onlynet=<em>network-list</em></dt>
	<dd>Only connect to nodes in network <em>net</em> (ipv4, ipv6 or onion)</dd>
<dt>-eb_seednode=<em>ip-list</em></dt>
	<dd>Connect to a node to retrieve peer addresses, and disconnect</dd>
</dl>

<p>If peer node addresses are specified via the -eb_connect option, then by default, DNS seed processing is not done.</p>

<p>Peer nodes specified by -eb_addnode processing are added to the nodes 
discovered by all other means.</p>

<p>Peer nodes specified by the -eb_seednode option are contacted exclusively
to discover other peers. Once the peer node information has been transmitted
to the node, the connection is ended.</p>

<p>eb_onlynet should be set to one or more of ipv4, ipv6 and onion. Connections will be limited to the specified network(s).</p> 

<h2>RPC Commands</h2>

<p>For each Bitcoin Core RPC, there is a corresponding Equibit Core RPC. The Equibit Core RPC name is the Bitcoin Core RPC name with a eb_ prefix. For example, Bitcoin Core RPC getmininginfo corresponds to Equibit Core RPC eb_getmininginfo. In addition, several new RPCs have been added to the Equibit Core interface in order to support Equibit Core functionality.
</p>
<p>Bitcoin RPCs are documented at <a href='https://bitcoin.org/en/developer-reference#remote-procedure-calls-rpcs'>Bitcoin Developer Reference</a></p>
<p>This documentation can be used for the corresponding Equibit RPCs, with the knowledge that:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Equibit Core uses separate TCP/IP networks</li>
<li>The Equibit Core wallet and blockchain data is stored to separate files</li>
</ul>

<h3>Equibit Specific RPCs</h3>
<p>The RPCs listed in the Equibit category of the eb_help output have no corresponding Bitcoin RPC.</p>
<p>They can be sub-categorized as follows:</p>

<h4>Equibit Issuer Commands</h4>

<ul>
<li>eb_getnewissuer - Creates a new issuer</li>
<li>eb_getissuers - Lists the issuers added to the wallet</li>
<li>eb_authorizeequibit - Authorizes Equibits by the specified issuer</li>
</ul>

<h4>Equibit Messaging Commands</h4>

<p>Three types of messages can be sent between Equibit Core users:

<ul>
<li>Peer-to-Peer Sent to a single peer user</li>
<li>Multicast    Sent to all issuers who are owners of specified Equibit asset</li>
<li>Broadcasr    Sent to all users</li>
</ul>
