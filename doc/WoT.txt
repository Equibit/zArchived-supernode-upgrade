=======================================================================================
These all talk about using PGP keys though... and we're using blockchain keys, but I 
think the concept is still the same.
=======================================================================================

In cryptography, a web of trust is a concept used to establish the authenticity of the 
binding between a public key and its owner. 

Its decentralized trust model is an alternative to the centralized trust model of a 
public key infrastructure (PKI), which relies exclusively on a certificate authority 
(or a hierarchy of such). 

There are many independent webs of trust, and any user can be a part of, and a link 
between, multiple webs.

As time goes on, you will accumulate keys from other people that you may want to 
designate as trusted introducers. Everyone else will each choose their own trusted 
introducers. And everyone will gradually accumulate and distribute with their key a 
collection of certifying signatures from other people, with the expectation that 
anyone receiving it will trust at least one or two of the signatures. This will 
cause the emergence of a decentralized fault-tolerant web of confidence for all 
public keys.

Operation of a web of trust

Certificates (which include public key(s) and owner information) can be digitally 
signed by other users who, by that act, endorse the association of that public key 
with the person or entity listed in the certificate. 

Implementations also include a vote counting scheme which can be used to determine 
which public key – owner association a user will trust while using PGP. For instance, 
if three partially trusted endorsers have vouched for a certificate (and so its 
included public key – owner binding), OR if one fully trusted endorser has done so, 
the association between owner and public key in that certificate will be trusted to 
be correct. The parameters are user-adjustable (e.g., no partials at all, or 
perhaps 6 partials) and can be completely bypassed if desired.

Simplified Explanation

In the web of trust, each user has a ring with a group of people's public keys.

Users encrypt their information with the recipient's public key, and only the 
owner's private key will decrypt it. Each user then digitally signs the information with their private key, so when they verify it with their own public key, they can confirm that it is the person in question. 

Web of trust problems

Certificates include expiry dates

designated revokers

A key owner may designate a third party that has permission to revoke the key 
owner's key (in case the key owner loses their own private key and thus loses 
the ability to revoke their own public key).

A trusts B if there exists a chain of public keys such that

	A trusts C1, C1 trusts C2, ..., Cn trusts B

	The length of the chain is N

	A may limit N. i.e. If the chain is longer then N, then A does not trust B. N_MAX >=1.
