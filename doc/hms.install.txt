Unix Install

Installation

After you have installed the software and connected an nShield Edge to your 
computer, you must complete further Security World creation, configuration and 
setup tasks before you can use your nShield environment to protect and manage 
your keys. See the User Guide for more about creating a Security World and the 
appropriate card sets, and further configuration or setup tasks.


 1) Java Install (http://www.webupd8.org/2012/09/install-oracle-java-8-in-ubuntu-via-ppa.html)

sudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/java
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install oracle-java8-installer

Accept License

echo oracle-java8-installer shared/accepted-oracle-license-v1-1 select true | sudo /usr/bin/debconf-set-selections

Set Env Vars

sudo apt-get install oracle-java8-set-default

 2) Place optical disk in drive and mount drive

	sudo mkdir /media/opt_disk	-- if no path is available
	sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /media/opt_disk

 3) cd /
 4) sudo tar xf /media/opt_disk/SecWorld-linux64-user-12.10.00/linux/libc6_11/amd64/nfast/ctls/agg.tar
   sudo tar xf /media/opt_disk/SecWorld-linux64-user-12.10.00/linux/libc6_11/amd64/nfast/ctls/agg.tar

 5) cd /opt/nfast/sbin
 6) sudo ./install
 7) Add /opt/nfast/bin to the PATH
 8) Make sure the computer will not go to sleep because it will cause the
    nShieldEdge to restart.
 9) Connect the nSheild Edge USB to the computer
10) sudo tailf /opt/nfast/log/hardserver.log
11) Run /opt/nfast/bin/enquiry to verify that the install was successful.
    The output should display mode equal to operational.
    If output says module is not found, try re-starting the computer.
12) See Chapter 8 for explaination of nSheild Edge buttons, lights and so on.
13) See Chapter 9 for trouble shooting.

Lights on left hand side:

red   (top)     In maintenance mode
amber (middle)  In initialization mode
green (bottom)  In operational mode

(Blue) Light on right hand side:

Long blue flashes	operational mode
Short blue flashes  initialization mode
Irregular flashes	changing mode or processing data

To change the mode:

1. Use the Mode button to highlight the required mode.
2. Within a few seconds, press and hold the Clear button for a couple of 
   seconds. If the mode changes, the new modeâ€™s LED stops flashing and remains 
   lit. The Status LED might flash irregularly for a few seconds and then 
   flashes regularly when the nShield Edge is ready. Otherwise, the nShield 
   Edge remains in the current mode, with the appropriate mode LED lit.
